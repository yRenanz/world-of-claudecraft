// Persistent town focus allocation (#1143): a player, while standing in a town
// hub, sets a persistent per-component-type focus allocation that adds a bonus
// on top of the universal baseline yield/tier for the chosen component
// type(s). Unfocused components are never affected: the baseline they'd get
// with zero allocation is unchanged regardless of how other components are
// focused. Consumes the #1142 per-corpse focus/tradeoff roll
// (professions/gathering.ts) as an input to the bonus calculation, but is
// itself independently buildable/testable against any baseline yield/tier.
//
// Pure leaf: no Sim/Entity import (matches gathering.ts). The "in town" gate
// is evaluated by the caller (Sim, which knows the player's zone/position) and
// passed in as a plain boolean, so this module never reaches into world state.
