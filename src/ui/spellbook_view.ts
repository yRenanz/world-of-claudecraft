// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the spellbook window.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-painter split (root CLAUDE.md
// Conventions; reference arena_window_view.ts / char_view.ts). It models the one
// thing the spellbook decides that is worth testing without a DOM: the class kit
// in display order, which abilities are known vs trainable, each known ability's
// rank, whether it currently sits on the action bar, and whether its add control
// is disabled (known, off the bar, but no free slot). The DOM/i18n + icon side
// lives in spellbook_window.ts; rendering is driven entirely off the structure
// here.
//
// DOM-free and i18n-free: rows carry the raw ability id + the resolved ability
// (read from IWorld.known) and raw numbers; the painter localizes the name /
// summary / rank label and resolves the icon. The known-vs-bar shape is the same
// for the offline Sim and the online ClientWorld mirror (both expose `known` +
// the bar), so the two produce identical rows.
//
// Phase 4 of the mobile combat HUD rework adds an optional `mobilePage` per row:
// which mobile action-ring page (Phase 1, mobile_action_page_view.ts) the row's
// bar slot falls on, so the touch-only painter can label it ("Page 1"/"Page 2").
// The page math is NOT duplicated here: sourceSlotsForMobilePage is imported
// from mobile_action_page_view.ts and this module only looks up which page's
// slot set contains the row's barSlot.
