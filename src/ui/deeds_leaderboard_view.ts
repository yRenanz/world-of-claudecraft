// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the RENOWN tab of the high-score window.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-painter split (sibling of
// leaderboard_view.ts / guild_leaderboard_view.ts / dev_leaderboard_view.ts).
// Like those cores this is ASYNC-FREE and DOM/i18n-free: it maps an
// already-resolved DeedsLeaderboardPage (or an explicit loading / error
// discriminator) to a render model the painter localizes. Rows carry the raw
// class id plus a `knownClass` flag (CLASSES is read here only to decide that
// flag) and the selected TITLE stays a deed id: the painter resolves it
// through deed_i18n.ts, never this core.
//
// The board is account-scored but character-faced (each row is the account's
// highest-Renown character), so the viewer's own row is flagged `me` by the
// server-resolved account rank on the page's `self` line (rank is a strict
// total order, so equality identifies the row exactly). Names are not
// identity here: the viewer may be on a lower alt, and the board is global
// across realms, so a same-named cross-realm character must not match. The
// same `self` line doubles as the account's own standing instead of a
// computed sticky row: the client cannot derive an account-level rank from
// what it can see.
