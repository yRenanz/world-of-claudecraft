// Pure, DOM-free core for the mobile consumables quick bar: turns the raw
// inventory into the ordered, capped list of consumable item ids whose slots
// the bar paints (through the shared action_bar_view core, which derives the
// per-slot count / potion-cooldown / usable state itself). Touch has no way to
// drag an item onto the hotbar, so unlike the desktop bar this list is
// AUTO-POPULATED from what the player is carrying: zero setup, the bag's
// "Consumables" category made castable. Host-agnostic (a Vitest drives it
// directly); registered in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES.
