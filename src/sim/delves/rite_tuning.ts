// Shared Drowned Reliquary Rite difficulty tuning: the ONE source both the sim
// controller (drowned_litany_rite.ts) and the HUD difficulty popup
// (src/ui/rite_window.ts) read, so the popup's advertised numbers can never
// desync from the sim. Pure data, no sim state and no DOM, mirroring how
// src/sim/lockpick.ts feeds src/ui/lockpick_panel.ts.

/** Player-chosen difficulty. Easy shows the sequence more times and grants more
 * tries but caps loot low; Hard shows it once, allows a single try, and is the only
 * path to premium. `ceiling` caps the mistake-derived tier, so difficulty is strictly
 * monotonic by reward. `tries` is the number of full attempts at repeating the
 * sequence; a wrong touch fails the current try, and the tolerated mistake count is
 * tries - 1 (the last try has no slack). */
