// World bosses: server-wide elites that rise on a fixed cadence, announce
// themselves, and reward every player who damaged them with PERSONAL loot, gated
// by a real raid lockout per boss (consumed by LOOTING, reset on the shared
// raid-reset boundary).
//
// This module owns the world-boss DATA (the spawn registry) and the pure pieces of
// the system: the per-player loot-lockout gate (a `meta.raidLockouts` entry, one
// source of truth with the raid-lockout UI), the contributor set derived from a
// boss's hate table, and the personal-loot roller. The SCHEDULER state and the
// spawn primitive live on `Sim` (it needs createMob/addEntity/groundPos), which
// drives this module each tick; the loot roller is reached through the SimContext
// seam (ctx.rollWorldBossLoot), exactly like ctx.rollLoot.
//
// Determinism (this is sim-core): no Math.random/Date.now, randomness is ctx.rng
// only, and the lockout boundary is the host lockout clock plus raid-reset instant
// (ctx.lockoutNowMs() / ctx.raidResetMs(), the same pair the dungeon raid lockouts
// use; the host wall clock on the server, the sim clock offline). The
// personal-loot roller draws rng in a FIXED order (contributors sorted by entityId,
// loot entries in array order) so the parity gate's rng draw-order log stays stable.
