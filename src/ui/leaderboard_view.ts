// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the lifetime-XP leaderboard window.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-painter split (root CLAUDE.md
// Conventions; reference arena_window_view.ts / market_view.ts). The leaderboard
// is the ONE async/paged window: the painter (leaderboard_window.ts)
// consumes IWorld.leaderboard(page, size): Promise<LeaderboardPage> and owns the
// Promise, the await, and the page controls. This core is ASYNC-FREE: it maps an
// already-resolved page (or an explicit loading / error discriminator) to a render
// model. The async/paged shape is exactly the online-only-shape trap
// catches (it passes every offline gate and silently misrenders online), so the
// core is fed BOTH a Sim-shaped and a ClientWorld-mirror-shaped page in the tests,
// across every state.
//
// DOM-free and i18n-free: rows carry the raw class id plus a `knownClass` flag the
// painter localizes (CLASSES is read here only to decide that flag), never the
// resolved display name; the loading / empty / error states are discriminators the
// painter resolves to t() copy.
