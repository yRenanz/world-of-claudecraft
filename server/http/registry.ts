// Phase 9 route registry for the API pipeline (docs/api-pipeline/).
//
// The registry assembles the per-domain RouteDef arrays (populated by the
// migration phases, Phase 10 onward) into ONE lookup that the Phase 9 dispatcher
// places in front of the legacy /api handleApi ladder: for a path the registry
// owns, the dispatcher runs the onion; for anything else it delegates to the
// legacy handler unchanged.
//
// resolve() does NOT reimplement matching: it reuses the Phase 4 router
// (server/http/router.ts) via createRouter(...).match, inheriting its static-
// first-then-dynamic scan, its 404-vs-405+Allow decision, HEAD-for-GET, the
// synthesized OPTIONS, trailing-slash normalization, and its build-time rejection
// of duplicate (method, shape) and HEAD/OPTIONS/junk registrations.
//
// What the registry OWNS on top of the router is the ordering the router
// deliberately leaves to it. The router matches dynamic patterns in REGISTRATION
// order with no specificity tiebreak, so two overlapping dynamic routes of
// different shape resolve to whichever was registered first. The registry sorts
// the routes MOST-SPECIFIC-FIRST before building the router so the more specific
// pattern wins, and it runs a build-time BOLA-shadow guard
// (assertNoOwnedRouteShadowing) that rejects any account-owned :id route left
// interceptable by an earlier, non-owned catch-all that would skip its ownership
// loader.

 * It is a no-op while apiRoutes is empty, but it is a recorded Phase 4 QA

 * requireOwned route would skip that route's ownership loader (a BOLA hole). The
 * specificity sort normally orders the owned route first; this guard fails the
 * build for any construction the sort cannot save.
 *
 * The check is deliberately proportionate. It ignores:
 *  - a STATIC owned route (the router matches the static exact-map before any
 *    dynamic pattern, so a static owned route is always reached first);
 *  - a STATIC earlier route (it matches exactly one reserved-literal path, never
 *    the owned :id family, so it is a special case, not a catch-all);
 *  - an earlier route under a DIFFERENT method (methods never share a match);
 *  - an earlier route that carries ANY requireOwned marker (it runs its own
 *    ownership loader, so the resource is still authorized);
 *  - an earlier route of the SAME shape (that is a duplicate the router rejects).
 * Shape-overlap is a structural comparison of the compiled segments: two
 * same-length patterns overlap unless some position is literal-vs-literal with
 * differing values (a param matches any non-empty segment, so a literal-vs-param
 * or param-vs-param position always has a common concrete path).
