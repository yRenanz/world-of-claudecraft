// Gathering tool tier gating (#1123, extended by #1135). A base gathering

// material tiers it can gather/harvest, via one shared comparator. This

// item-shape helpers, so it is Vitest-importable directly (like
// threat.ts/spatial.ts).
//
// This repo has no durability mechanic anywhere in ItemDef (see types.ts):
// a base gathering tool never carries a durability field, so it can never
// become unusable from durability loss. That is a property of the item shape,

// `resolveToolEffectUse(slot, outcome, rng, confirmed)` using the SAME `Rng`
// the caller already draws from (never a fresh one) so the depletion roll
// (when it fires) takes its place in the one shared draw order. `confirmed`
// should come from the player's client request for a 'prompt' slot (see the

// `true` unconditionally, which is equivalent to every slot behaving as
// 'always'. `rechargeEffect` (#1137) has the same no-live-call-site status:
