// Divergence-only dialect overlay for "en_CA" over base locale "en".
//
// "en_CA" inherits from "en": the build (scripts/i18n_build.mjs) resolves it as
// nested `en` -> this overlay, so any key absent here falls through to English. This file
// therefore carries ONLY the keys whose value differs from en; every other key is
// intentionally omitted. A key must NOT be re-added with a value equal to en
// (redundant duplication). Every key here must be a real `en` leaf
// path (tests/i18n_overlay_key_membership.test.ts + the byte gate). Keys are in `en`'s
// leaf order.
