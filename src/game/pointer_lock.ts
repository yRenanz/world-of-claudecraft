// camera rotation. Kept DOM-free so it unit-tests in isolation (the same
// pattern as click_move.ts / pointer_pick.ts).
//
// Why this exists: camera rotation integrates relative mouse deltas
// (movementX/movementY). Without pointer lock the OS cursor is free to leave
// the window, so it hits the monitor edge (movementX clamps to 0, the camera
// freezes) or slips onto a second display. Locking the pointer while a drag is
// active keeps every delta flowing and the cursor pinned to the canvas.

 * banner-flicker bug for its ordinary clicks (loot/target/interact, or
 * click-to-move itself). A genuine drag started on the click-to-move button
 * still falls back to the deferred `mousemove` request, which Firefox denies
 * outside fullscreen, so on Firefox that one drag start stays unfixed: an
 * accepted trade-off (see `input.ts`'s mousedown comment). A press that
 * turns out to be a plain click on a non-click-to-move button still releases
 * the lock on mouseup via {@link shouldReleasePointerLock}.
