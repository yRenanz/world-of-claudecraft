# Sound Effects: design, catalog and integration

Sampled sound effects for World of ClaudeCraft, played through a lightweight Web
Audio engine. Natural world and character cues can be produced with the
**ElevenLabs Sound Effects API** (`POST /v1/sound-generation`); UI/event cues use
deterministic local FFmpeg synthesis. This document is the human-readable
catalog. The authoritative machine list (prompts, durations, loop flags, and
generator ownership) lives in `scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs`.

## Goals
- **Immersive world layer:** footsteps that change with surface (grass / dirt /
  stone / wood / snow / water), swimming, jumping/landing, weapon swings &
  material-aware impacts, per-school spell cast/projectile/impact, per-family
  creature vocalizations, and ambient loops (wind, water, campfire, forge,
  dungeon, weather).
- **Correct spatial / proximal audio:** every world sound is positioned in 3D, so
  *other* players' and creatures' footsteps and combat attenuate with distance and
  pan with direction relative to the camera. Personal UI events (level-up, loot,
  quest, coin) stay non-positional.
- **Extreme efficiency:** one decoded buffer per published track (shared), a hard concurrency
  cap, distance culling that reuses the renderer's own range gate, per-entity
  footstep throttling, pooled looping sources, and zero per-frame allocation in
  the hot path.

## Authoring policy
World, combat, creature, ambience, and personal UI cues all live in the sampled
catalog. `src/game/audio.ts` remains a compatibility facade for its established
method names, but routes reachable UI calls through `sfx.playUi()` so every sound
is visible, previewable, replaceable, and masterable in the SFX Studio. The
deterministic `scripts/gen_ui_sfx.mjs` generator supplies the initial UI masters;
ElevenLabs remains the optional generator for natural world and character audio.

## Architecture

### `src/game/sfx.ts` — `Sfx` (singleton `sfx`)
A decoupled 3D engine with **its own `AudioContext` + `AudioListener`** (siblings:
`audio`/`music`/`voice`). Driven by the `sfxVolume` setting (wired alongside
`audio.setVolume` in `main.ts`). API:
- `init()` — gated on the same user gesture as `audio.init()` (`enterWorld`);
  preloads the startup working set and lazily deduplicates fetch/decode work for
  contextual cues.
- `setListener(x,y,z, fx,fy,fz)` — called once per frame by the renderer with the
  camera position + forward vector.
- `playAt(key, x,y,z, opts?)` — one-shot positional clip via a `PannerNode`
  (equalpower, linear rolloff, hard `maxDistance` cutoff). Random ±6% rate / ±2dB
  gain jitter so repeats (footsteps, swings) never machine-gun. Caller rate and
  jitter multiply the per-key authored playback rate from the manifest.
- `playUi(key, opts?)` — non-positional one-shot straight to the master bus.
- `loop(id, key, target, x?,y?,z?)` / `unloop(id, fade)` are pooled looping
  sources for ambience and sustained casts, cross-faded by gain and started at
  the per-key authored playback rate.
- Concurrency cap (`MAX_VOICES`), buffer cache, and a per-key cooldown protect the
  frame budget. Unknown keys / missing files are silent no-ops.

### Renderer integration (movement) — `src/render/renderer.ts`
Render must not import `game/`, so the renderer holds an injected
`SpatialAudioSink` interface (declared in `src/render/audio_sink.ts`); `main.ts`
wires the real `sfx` into it. In the existing per-entity `sync()` loop (~L1166–1338,
which already computes interpolated position, `loco.speed/moving`, `swimming`,
`airborne`, and squared distance `d2` to the player):
- **Footsteps:** a per-`EntityView` distance accumulator (`stepAccum += speed*dt`)
  fires `sink.footstep(x,y,z, surface, running, self)` each stride. Surface =
  `zoneBiomeAt(z)` (vale→grass, marsh→dirt, peaks→stone) → water if wading →
  dock decks→wood → dungeon→stone → snow if weather is snowing. Suppressed while airborne /
  swimming / dead and gated by `d2 < SFX_RANGE_SQ`.
- **Jump / land / splash / swim:** per-view edge detection on `airborne` and
  `swimming` transitions fires `sink.movement('jump'|'land'|'splash'|'swim', …)`.
- **Listener:** after the camera is positioned (~L1583), `sink.setListener(camPos,
  forward)`.

### Combat / event integration — `src/ui/hud.ts`
`handleEvents()` (~L2991–3279) already iterates drained `SimEvent`s with live
entity positions. It imports the `sfx` singleton (precedent: it already imports
`game/audio`) and, per event, plays positional clips at the relevant entity:
- `damage` → attacker **swing** (by weapon class of source) + target **impact** (by
  school for spells, by target material for physical: flesh / metal / leather /
  bone); `kind:'miss'|'dodge'` → whiff/dodge; `kind:'parry'` → parry; `crit` →
  overlay `combat_crit`. Player-as-target physical → `player_hurt`.
- `castStart` → per-school sustained `cast_*` loop at the caster, stopped on
  `castStop`/`death`. `spellfx{fx:'projectile'}` → `proj_<school>`; `fx:'nova'` →
  `spell_nova`. `heal2`/`heal` → `heal_impact`. `aura{gained}` →
  `buff_apply`/`debuff_apply`.
- `death` → creature **family death** (mob) or `player_death`. Mob **aggro**
  vocalization fires the first time a mob deals damage (no aggro SimEvent exists).
- Personal UI events keep the stable `audio.*` call surface while the facade
  resolves those calls to typed sampled `ui_*` keys.

### Surface & family mapping
- **Surface** (footsteps): `vale→grass`, `marsh→dirt`, `peaks→stone`, dock deck
  footprints→`wood`, dungeon→`stone`, wading (`y≤WATER_LEVEL-0.3` & not deep)→`water`,
  deep→`swim`, weather snow→`snow`. Source: the pure render audio resolver,
  `zoneBiomeAt`, `groundHeight`, and `WATER_LEVEL` from `src/sim/world.ts`.
- **Creature family** (vocalizations): `MOBS[templateId].family` maps to one of
  `beast`, `boar`, `spider`, `mudfin`, `burrower`, `humanoid`, `undead`, `troll`,
  `ogre`, `elemental`, `dragonkin`, or `demon`, with a
  `wild_boar`/`elder_bristleback` to **boar** templateId override.
- **Weapon class** (swings) & **material** (impacts) derive from the source/target
  player class or mob family (plate: warrior/paladin → metal; leather: rogue/hunter/
  shaman; cloth: mage/priest/warlock/druid; undead → bone; else flesh).

## Catalog

`spatial` = positioned 3D; `loop` = seamless looping (ElevenLabs `loop:true`).
Keys map to `public/audio/sfx/<key>.mp3`; the independently generated manifest
`src/game/sfx_manifest.generated.ts` carries a content hash, immutable URL,
preload class, spatial flag, byte count, resolved runtime gain, and playback rate.
An entry may declare ordered variants. Their files use
`public/audio/sfx/<key>_<number>.mp3`, and accepted one-shots cycle through the
ordered tracks. A persistent loop chooses one track when it starts and keeps it
until that loop stops.

### Interface and personal event cues

These cues are non-positional, preload at startup, and keep the existing
`GameAudio` method surface. They are sampled assets, so they use the same Studio
editing, mastering, caching, and playback limits as the world catalog.

|---|---|
| `ui_click`, `ui_error` | basic interaction and invalid-action feedback |
| `ui_bag_open`, `ui_bag_close` | inventory transitions |
| `ui_coin`, `ui_loot_item` | currency and item rewards |

## Generation
`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... node scripts/gen_sfx.mjs [--force]` reads
`scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs`, calls `POST /v1/sound-generation` per clip
(`duration_seconds`, `prompt_influence` 0.4, `loop` per entry,
`output_format=mp3_44100_128`), writes `public/audio/sfx/<key>.mp3`, and emits
the sampled files. `node scripts/build_sfx_manifest.mjs` independently emits
`src/game/sfx_manifest.generated.ts` with URLs of the form
`/audio/sfx/<key>.mp3?v=<content-hash>`. Generation is idempotent
(skips existing; `--force` to regenerate). Offline-only; the key is never read at
runtime. Exact versioned SFX URLs receive immutable production caching; unhashed
or stale URLs must revalidate.

`npm run sfx:ui -- --force` rebuilds the deterministic sampled UI cues
locally with FFmpeg. Their fixed synthesis parameters and noise seeds make the
assets repeatable for a given FFmpeg build. The shared production conform step
then emits 44.1 kHz, 192 kbps MP3s using the same short-true-peak and sustained-LUFS
branches as every other catalog cue. Run
`npm run sfx:manifest` after any direct asset generation or replacement.

For the complete authoring and artifact workflow, see the
[SFX Studio tutorial](../sfx-studio-tutorial.md). For editing, run
`npm run sfx:studio`. The loopback-only Studio inventories the
catalog, previews associated animations and environments, validates uploads,
supports non-destructive slicing and seam crossfades, fades, reverse, multi-band
EQ, compression, two-pass EBU R128 normalization, limiter and encoded-file QA.
Audio Publish bakes that authoring work and transactionally publishes the
verified MP3 and tracked render recipe, then regenerates the manifest for the
new content hash. Apply Playback Mix writes only the checked-in gain and speed
maps and regenerates the manifest. It does not render, conform, resample, or
otherwise change the audio bytes.
Runtime loop cues cannot bypass seam processing, and one-shots cannot be
reclassified as loops.

### Production export

The Studio toolbar's Export All action downloads a deterministic production ZIP
from every published SFX master and the applied playback profile. Export is
blocked while saved playback changes are unapplied or saved audio drafts differ
from their publication baselines. Local uploads, previews, version history,
music, and NPC voice lines are not part of this SFX artifact.

The artifact stores audio as immutable
`audio/sfx/blobs/<full-sha256>.mp3` files and includes a stable
`audio/sfx/runtime-pack.json`, authoring maps, integrity metadata, and an
installer. Run `node install.mjs <production-static-root>` after extracting the
ZIP. The installer verifies and copies every blob first, then atomically replaces
the stable runtime manifest. Production can set `SFX_PACK_DIR` to a persistent
overlay's `audio/sfx` directory. Docker Compose maps `EASTBROOK_SFX_DIR` for this
purpose, so a container rebuild does not discard an installed pack.

The client accepts a pack only when its compiled catalog hash matches, every
fixed key is present, and any extra keys match the constrained mob-subfamily
grammar. A malformed, incomplete, external-URL, or incompatible pack is rejected
as a whole and playback uses the compiled generated manifest. New event routing
or a new fixed SFX key still requires a normal game code deployment.

### Runtime mix and speed

Cross-clip balance is separate from asset mastering. Trim, slices, fades, seam
construction, reverse, EQ, dynamics, loudness, and encoding remain baked in the
published asset. The reversible playback controls live in two plain-data files:

- `scripts/sfx/sfx_gain_map.json` stores category baseline dB plus per-key
  fine-tune dB. The layers add, and the resolved value must stay at or below
  0 dB.
- `scripts/sfx/sfx_speed_map.json` stores the playback rate for each adjusted
  key.

Manifest generation resolves both maps into a linear `gain` multiplier and a
`playbackRate` for every key. At playback, `src/game/sfx.ts` applies the gain to
the cue's `GainNode` and the rate to its `AudioBufferSourceNode`. One-shot caller
rate and pitch jitter layer on top. This uses Web Audio resampling, so speed and
pitch move together. The maps stay independent of rendering and any separate
conform process, so applying either one never changes the source or published
audio hash.

Studio audition A is the untouched source bypass. B previews the live authoring
graph with runtime mix and speed, while C applies the same runtime values to the
exact rendered master. This keeps comparisons honest without putting playback
decisions into rendered bytes.

Model and environment cues use real game assets in the context viewer. Personal
UI cues use cue-specific representative interface mocks, clearly labeled as
non-positional authoring context rather than pretending an unrelated model is
the live HUD. The Studio inventories published masters without silently changing
them. Existing cues keep their current balance until an author listens and
applies a reviewed playback-map change; audio mastering remains a separate
publish. Every new Studio exact render and publish ends in the shared 44.1 kHz,
192 kbps production conform pass. Spatial stereo files are folded to one retained
channel after runtime decode to reduce positional buffer memory.

## Efficiency budget
- One decoded `AudioBuffer` per loaded clip, shared across all sources. Only the
  startup set is eager; contextual assets are loaded once on demand.
- `MAX_VOICES` concurrent one-shots; over-cap plays are dropped (oldest-wins).
- Footsteps gated by `d2 < SFX_RANGE_SQ` (reuses the renderer's per-entity squared
  distance) and a per-entity stride accumulator — no timers, no per-frame alloc.
- Ambience/cast loops are a small pool of persistent sources, cross-faded by gain.
- Listener updated once per frame; panners use cheap `equalpower` + linear rolloff
  with a hard `maxDistance` so far sounds cost nothing.
