# python/: Gymnasium client bindings

Thin Python client over the headless env. **No game logic lives here**, it
spawns the Node bundle and talks NDJSON over its stdin/stdout. The protocol is
defined by `headless/env_server.ts`; these are two halves of one wire format, so
**changing a command/field on either side means changing both.**

## How it works
- `WoWClassicEnv(gym.Env)` in `wow_env.py`: `__init__` runs
  `subprocess.Popen(["node", server])` (server defaults to
  `../dist-env/env_server.cjs`, override with `server_path=` / interpreter with
  `node_binary=`; raises `FileNotFoundError` telling you to run `npm run build:env`
  if absent). Each env owns its own subprocess; `make_env(**kwargs)` is the
  factory for `gymnasium.vector` envs.
- Every call is one request/one reply line via `_request()` (write+flush stdin,
  `readline` stdout); an `{"error":...}` reply becomes a `RuntimeError`.
- Spaces are **queried at startup** from the `info` cmd, never hardcoded (trust the
  queried spaces over any prose or docstring):
  - `observation_space = Box(-2.0, 2.0, shape=(obs_size,), float32)`
  - `action_space = Discrete(num_actions)`; `action_names` = the `ACTIONS` list.
- `reset(seed=...)`/`step(action)` return the Gymnasium 5-tuple
  (`obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info`); `obs` is `np.float32`.
  `close()` sends `{"cmd":"close"}` then waits/kills the proc.

## New behavior lands TS-side
A new action, obs field, or command is a `src/sim/obs.ts` / `headless/` change
first (see `headless/CLAUDE.md`), pinned by `tests/env_protocol.test.ts`; this
client only mirrors the wire fields, keep it thin. End-to-end smoke after any
protocol change: `python example_random_agent.py` (random policy + IPC throughput).

## Gotchas
- **The Node bundle must be rebuilt** after any change to `src/sim/` or
  `headless/`, this client loads `dist-env/env_server.cjs`, not the TS source.
- **stderr is swallowed**: `wow_env.py` spawns the server with
  `stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL`, so a crashed server surfaces only as
  `RuntimeError("env server died")` with the Node stack trace discarded. To
  diagnose, poke the bundle directly (`echo '{"cmd":"info"}' | node
  dist-env/env_server.cjs`) or temporarily pass `stderr=None` in the `Popen`.
