// Pure predicates for the optional "Auto-Attack on Ability Use" QoL setting: given
// an ability's (rank-resolved) effects, decide whether using it should also engage
// the player's white-swing auto-attack, and given the player's current target, decide
// whether engaging would actually connect (rather than error). Host-agnostic (type-only
// sim import), so a Vitest drives them directly; the HUD gates on the player's setting.

import type { AbilityEffect, Entity } from '../sim/types';

// Auto-attack classification of EVERY AbilityEffect type. Because this is a Record over
// the discriminant union, adding a new effect to `AbilityEffect` (src/sim/types.ts) is a
// COMPILE error here until it is classified, which is what keeps the sets below honest:
//   'damage'  - deals damage to a target, so the ability is an "attack" (Sinister Strike,
//               Fireball, Mortal Strike, Eviscerate, the AOEs) and should start auto-attack.
//   'breakCC' - crowd control that BREAKS when the target takes damage. The sim flags these
//               auras `breaksOnDamage` at their emit sites (`incapacitate`/`polymorph` in
//               combat/effect_dispatch.ts); a swing would shatter the CC, so an ability
//               applying one must NEVER start auto-attack even when it also deals damage
//               (gouge does both). A future break-on-damage CC effect MUST be classified
//               here, not 'other', or a damage+CC ability built on it would break its own CC.
//   'other'   - heal/buff/utility/non-breaking CC (stun, root, slow): irrelevant either way.
