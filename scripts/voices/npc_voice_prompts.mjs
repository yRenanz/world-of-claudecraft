// Machine-readable companion to docs/design/npc_voices.md — the source of truth
// for ElevenLabs voice design. One entry per DISTINCT voice (17 total). Brother
// Aldric and Scout Maren each get a single voice even though they recur across
// zones under suffixed NPC ids (brother_aldric_fen, scout_maren_highwatch, …);
// gen_npc_lines.mjs maps those recurring ids back to the base voice via VOICE_ALIAS.
//
// Each `voiceDescription` is the voice-direction paragraph from npc_voices.md;
// `sampleText` is that NPC's "Voice test" sentence. npcId uses the canonical
// content key from src/sim/content/{zone1,zone2,zone3,temple}.ts.
