# src/ui/: classic HUD, i18n, procedural icons

The classic-MMO HUD: unit/party frames, action bar, all windows, tooltips, world map +
minimap, combat log, floating combat text, plus the locale table and runtime-drawn icons.

## How this area works
- **Plain DOM + canvas, no UI framework.** The HUD queries pre-existing DOM
  (`$('#...')` from `index.html`) and builds the rest with `innerHTML` /
  `createElement`; no virtual DOM, reactivity, or component lib.
- **Reads from / acts through `IWorld` only** (`world_api.ts`, see src/ CLAUDE.md);
  it never imports `Sim`/`ClientWorld`. It also takes `Renderer` + out-of-band glue
  via `OptionsHooks`/`ReportHooks` wired by `main.ts`.
- All HTML interpolation goes through `esc()`. **Never `innerHTML` raw
  player/server text**: names, chat, guild names, etc. must pass through `esc`.

## UI/UX, mobile & accessibility standards
The HUD ships to real players on desktop **and** phones, so verify every visible control in
mobile portrait *and* landscape before calling UI work done.
- **Aesthetic:** premium dark-fantasy theme (deep darks, gold-brown accents, rich borders);
  avoid default browser-chrome looks. **No raw emojis as in-game icons**: use the procedural
  `icons.ts` recipes (below) or real art. Transitions are interruption-safe cross-fades, never
  causing layout shift.
- **Layout stability:** content updates must not resize the parent, jump, or clip. Prefer
  `width:100%` + `max-width` over viewport units like `92vw` (they overflow once
  margins/padding are added). Flex/grid + fluid type; no ad-hoc inline styles.
- **Mobile touch** (gate on touch capability / runtime state, not only `max-width`: landscape
  phones need it too):
  - Every visible `input`/`select`/`textarea` is **>=16px** font, or iOS Safari auto-zooms the
    page on focus (it ignores the viewport `user-scalable=no`/`maximum-scale`; font-size is the
    only reliable fix). Enforced centrally by the `@media (pointer: coarse)` 16px `!important`
    floor in `src/styles/base.css` (the admin bundle mirrors it in `src/admin/styles/`); never
    set a per-control mobile font below 16px. Regression check:
    `node scripts/mobile_input_zoom_check.mjs` (needs `npm run dev`).
  - Every tappable target stays **>=40x40px** on mobile touch (the preferred floor); 24x24px
    (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8) is the absolute minimum, used only where 40x40 is genuinely infeasible.
    Do NOT weaken the 40x40 floor to 24px.
  - Narrow headers collapse to a hamburger drawer rather than wrapping/overflowing.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA):** correct semantics / ARIA, high-contrast `:focus-visible` on
  every custom interactive element, honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (drop cross-fades, content
  translations, camera auto-rotate); **no `transform: scale()` on hover/focus** of list/rail/
  chip items (motion-sickness trigger). Accessible names are still `t()` keys (see i18n below).
- **HUD-chrome WCAG 2.2 AA contract.** The chrome (windows, buttons, forms, menus, chat,
  tooltips) is in scope; the 3D world / game canvas is OUT of scope (not screen-readable, never
  faked with aria). On top of the per-control basics:
  - **Focus management:** opening a window TRAPS Tab/Shift+Tab inside it and RETURNS focus to
    the opener on close, via the one shared `FocusManager` (`src/ui/focus_manager.ts`), which
    `Hud` drives through `windowFocus(rootSel)`. The trap intercepts Tab ONLY when focus is
    already inside (Tab is the game's target-nearest key; an unconditional trap would hijack
    it). Esc stays with the single `closeAll` dispatcher, not the manager.
  - **Visible focus that never animates away:** every outline-based `:focus-visible` ring is
    steady and drawn from a token / system color, never a raw hex, never transitioned off.
  - **Skip links** ("Skip to Main HUD" / "Skip to Chat") are the first focusable elements;
    **live regions** announce chat (`#chatlog` role=log) and combat (off-screen `#combat-live`
    role=status, throttled per type).
  - **`forced-colors: active`** is the only AUTOMATIC contrast adaptation (no
    `prefers-color-scheme` auto-switch): borders + the focus ring survive via system-color
    keywords. (The theme picker also offers user-selectable presets; see `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.)
  - **No viewport scale-lock:** `user-scalable=no` / `maximum-scale` are dropped; the 16px
    input-font floor is the anti-zoom guard.
  - Enforced always-on by the `tests/focus_*` / `live_region_politeness` / `combat_announcer` /
    `client_shell` suites; the axe-core + keyboard-reachability + rendered target-size checks are
    the opt-in browser suite (`npm run test:browser`, chromium-only locally).

## Per-frame performance contract (write-elision + tiering)
Per-frame HUD code (anything reached from `Hud.update()`) holds these:
- **Write-elision.** Every per-frame DOM write goes through the host's elided writers
  (`setText`/`setDisplay`/`setTransform`/`setWidth` + the multi-slot `setStyleProp`/
  `toggleClass`/`setAttr`), bound over the private `hotWriteCache` field in `src/ui/hud.ts`
  and exposed to painters via `src/ui/painter_host.ts` (`PainterHostWriters` /
  `makeWriterFacet`). The cache key is byte-identical so an unchanged value skips the DOM.
  ALSO elide the expensive upstream RESOLVE, not just the write: diff a stable key and re-run
  the costly producer (icon data-URL, image decode, tooltip HTML) only when the key changes
  (`action_bar_painter` `lastIcon`, `auras_painter` `lastIconKey`, `unit_portrait_painter`
  `imgCache`). A painter NEVER calls `el.textContent =` / `style.*` / `setAttribute` /
  `innerHTML` directly; both the elision mechanism and the no-raw-write rule are guarded
  always-on (`tests/painter_host.test.ts` + the per-painter source scans).
- **Allocation-light cores.** A per-frame view-core returns a REUSED, preallocated container +
  slots (no per-frame array/object garbage); jitter/clock stay in the painter, never the core.
  Guarded always-on by the reference-stability probe `tests/util/alloc_probe.ts`.
- **The perf gate.** `scripts/perf_tour.mjs` (run per per-frame phase against the recorded
  baseline) asserts `frameP95 <= baseline` and a bounded AoE-burst FCT node count; each
  green-gate commit is TAGGED so a cumulative regression bisects. The STANDING vitest budget
  is `tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts`, split by host: it scans every hot painter for raw writes
  AND per-frame forced-reflow layout reads (`offsetWidth`/`getBoundingClientRect`/..., the
  layout-thrash killer); drives the non-pooled painters through a `makeWriterFacet` loop
  asserting establishing-write + elision for BOTH a Sim- and a `ClientWorld`-shaped input; and
  (gated behind `HUD_PERF_BUDGET_TOUR=1`) asserts on EVERY viewport the run-length-INDEPENDENT
  elision-bypass COUNT `hudHotDomWrites <= 153` (a COUNT, NOT the skip RATIO, whose denominator
  is the frame count and jitters run-to-run), plus the FCT pool stays at/under `FCT_POOL_CAP`.
  The committed baseline (`tests/hud_perf_budget.baseline.md`) is READ for both anchors (it
  throws if absent, never defaults).
- **Two controllers stay separate.** HUD tier knobs read the STATIC graphics preset via
  `src/game/ui_effects_profile.ts` (the `data-fx-level` stamp), NEVER `governor.state()`;
  `Hud.fxTier()` resolves the static stamp through `coerceFxTier`. This is the perf half of the
  gameplay-neutral-graphics invariant (root `CLAUDE.md`). Guarded by `tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts`,
  the `ui_tier_knobs` purity row in `tests/architecture.test.ts`, and
  `tests/ui_effects_profile.test.ts`.

### Canvas and DOM hot-path techniques (the proven patterns)
The contract above is the WHAT; reach for the matching one when you build a hot HUD component
(each names its exemplar):
- **Resolve element refs ONCE** into a field at construction, never `$()`/`querySelector` from
  a per-frame path (a re-query every frame was a real leak; `hud.ts` caches `xpbarEl` etc.).
- **Pool + keyed-reconcile, never per-frame `innerHTML` / `createElement`.** For a per-event or
  per-entity collection (FCT, auras, party), keep a persistent node pool, reconcile a keyed list
  with minimal `insertBefore` moves, recycle departed nodes, and CAP the live count (FIFO-evict
  past the cap). `auras_painter` (keyed pool + `reconcileOrder`), `fct_painter` (pool + FIFO cap).
- **Offscreen-canvas background cache.** Render static geometry ONCE to a detached canvas keyed
  by what it depends on (zone+seed, module id), then `drawImage`-blit it each redraw; only the
  dynamic markers re-stroke per frame (`delve_map_painter`, the per-zone `mapBgCache`, the
  `minimapBg` terrain canvas).
- **Set loop-invariant canvas state once.** Assigning `ctx.font` re-parses the font string every
  time, so set `font` / `fillStyle` / `lineWidth` before a draw loop, not per glyph
  (`map_window_painter`).
- **DPR backing store only where it must be crisp.** A HiDPI canvas sizes its backing store to
  `devicePixelRatio` and reassigns `width`/`height` only when the DPR changes (assignment clears
  the canvas); portraits are DPR-scaled (`unit_portrait_painter`), the minimap/map/delve are 1:1.
- **Prewarm heavy canvas work off the interaction.** A multi-hundred-ms render is painted a few
  rows per `requestIdleCallback` slice and cached, so opening the map never pays it synchronously
  (`hud.ts` `prewarmMapBg`).
- **Transform vs layout, honestly.** No blanket prefer-transform rule: reach for
  `transform`/`opacity` when an element actually MOVES every frame (nameplates), and lean on
  write-once + elision otherwise (FCT writes its screen-anchored `left`/`top` once at spawn; bars
  write `width` through the elided writer).

CSS tokens, `@layer` order, browser matrix, and bundle discipline: `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.

## hud.ts navigation map (one class `Hud`)
Every region is fenced by a `// ----` banner: enumerate the live set with
`grep -n '// ----' -A1 src/ui/hud.ts` and jump by banner text or method name, never a line
number (the region list drifts too fast to copy here). The non-greppable facts:
- `update()` is the per-frame entry; `handleEvents(events)` feeds log/FCT/audio/banners
  (`onEvent` lives on the `meters` helper, not `Hud`). A new event sound is a `combat_sfx.ts`
  mapping (`tests/combat_sfx.test.ts`), never inline `hud.ts` audio code.
- Toggle/open methods (`toggleBags`, `openVendor`, ...) are the public surface `main.ts`/input
  call.

**Where a new UI feature lands (module-first).** Every new window, panel, frame, or bar is its
own small `src/ui/` module built by the recipe below (pure `*_view`/`*_core` plus a thin
painter on the `PainterHost` seam), composed by `Hud`, NEVER a new banner section or method
cluster in `hud.ts` (see the root Modularity section). Its test is a Vitest in
`tests/<name>.test.ts` driving the pure core directly. Bug fixes are test-first: a failing
test that reproduces the bug (extract the buried unit into its own module if needed), then the
smallest change that turns it green.

### Authoring a new HUD component (the recipe)
One recipe for a new window/panel or a per-frame frame/bar, and for migrating one out of
`hud.ts` (the merge-conflict tax this pays down). Migrate one at a time, on the rule of three;
follow the root `extract-and-test` skill for the move-not-rewrite mechanics. The UI parts:
- **Pure view-core** `src/ui/<name>_view.ts` (or `_core.ts`): maps `IWorld` (+ raw inputs) to a
  render model; DOM/Three/i18n-free; INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED (a descriptor/id, no hardcoded
  element id); allocation-light if per-frame. NAME it `*_view`/`*_core` (NOT a bare name): the
  `architecture.test.ts` COMPLETENESS sweep asserts every on-disk `*_view`/`*_core` is registered,
  so the convention name is what makes a forgotten registration FAIL the guard instead of silently
  escaping the purity scan. Register it in the `UI_PURE_CORES` allowlist there. Test it
  same-input-same-output against BOTH a Sim- and a `ClientWorld`-shaped stub.
- **Thin painter** `src/ui/<name>_window.ts` (or `_painter.ts`): paints/updates nodes and wires
  callbacks via an injected `deps` object; owns no state and never imports `Hud`. ALL DOM writes
  go through the `PainterHost` elided writers; it drives tokens / CSS vars, never a literal
  hex/px/color in TS (the per-painter no-magic-values source guard). Interpolated names pass
  through `esc()`; a pure extraction reuses existing `t()` keys and adds none.
- **For chrome:** satisfy the HUD-chrome WCAG 2.2 AA contract above; mark the window root with
  `markDialogRoot` (`src/ui/dialog_root.ts`): role=dialog + aria-modal + exactly ONE accessible
  name (labelledBy wins and clears aria-label), cold-path raw `setAttribute` BY DESIGN (not
  `PainterHost`, not a registered pure core; `tests/dialog_root.test.ts`). **For a hot
  component:** keep the core allocation-light, pass the perf gate, read the static preset (not
  the governor), and apply the matching canvas hot-path technique.
- **Reuse a FAMILY before building bespoke:** a unit-style frame is a new `UnitFramePainter`
  instance (`unit_frame.ts` + `unit_frame_painter.ts`); an extra action bar is another
  `ActionBarPainter` from a new bar descriptor (`action_bar_view.ts` + `action_bar_painter.ts`).
- **`Hud` stays the orchestrator.** Keep `open<Window>`/`close<Window>` in `Hud` (cross-window
  coordination needs its private state); the per-render method shrinks to: resolve the entity,
  build the view, call the module with `deps`.

## i18n (sparse-overlay model; contributors add ENGLISH ONLY)
The locale data is split; touch the right file (full model + locked-terms glossary:
`docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md`):
- **`i18n.catalog/`** is the authoritative English source catalog (nested domain modules
  `shell`/`hud`/`hud_chrome`/`abilities`/`quests`/`items`/`game`/`merge`/`guide`/`editor`/
  `api_error` + an `index.ts` barrel) that drives `TranslationKey = Leaves<typeof en, 6>`, the
  dotted-path type every `t()` uses. Add a new English string in the matching domain module.
- **`i18n.locales/<lang>.ts`** are the non-English flat sparse overlays
  (`Partial<Record<TranslationKey,string>>`), the ONLY files a translator edits (the
  contributor rules are in the workflow below).
- **`i18n.resolved.generated/`** is the generated dense table the runtime imports (committed,
  regenerated by `npm run i18n:build`; the `i18n.status.json` registry is gitignored, only the
  counts-only `i18n.status.summary.json` is committed).
- **`i18n.ts`** is the thin runtime: `t()`/`tOptional`/`tPlural`, `hasTranslation`, the
  formatters, language get/set. The locale set derives from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` in the
  generated `loaders.ts`. **Lazy locale flip:** only `en`/`en_XA`/`pending`/`loaders` are
  eager; the non-en slices load on demand via `await ensureLocaleLoaded(lang)`. `setLanguage`
  is synchronous and does NOT load; `main.ts` awaits `ensureLocaleLoaded` before localized
  paint and each picker switch.

**Generated-artifact merge conflicts** (`i18n.status.summary.json`, `i18n.resolved.sha256`,
any `i18n.resolved.generated/` slice) are **never hand-resolved**: take either side, run
`npm run i18n:gen`, and `git add` the result. The output is deterministic, so a second
`i18n:gen` must leave the tree clean (your proof; CI's freshness step checks the same). A
rising `pending` count after merging a `release/**` branch is expected and fine at PR tier.

`t(key)` **throws on an untracked key in dev/test**, renders English for a `pending` key on
**non-release builds only**, and **hard-fails a pending key on a release build**
(`isReleaseBuild()` = `I18N_RELEASE=1` or `import.meta.env.PROD`).

**Contributor workflow (add a player-visible string): add ENGLISH ONLY.**
1. Add the key to `en` (the matching `i18n.catalog/<domain>.ts` module) and render it through
   `t()`. **Never edit the `i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` overlays, and never put English / a
   `// TODO` / a placeholder into one.** Leave the key omitted; the build English-fills it and
   marks it `pending` (the maintainer batch-fills every locale at release).
2. If the string originates in `src/sim/` or `server/` (which stay language-agnostic), register
   a matcher RULE in the table matching the emit's ORIGIN (`sim_i18n.ts` for a `src/sim/` emit,
   `server_i18n.ts` for a `server/` emit) in the SAME change. The S3 guard
   (`tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`) fails if a new emit is recognized by neither.
3. Run `npm run i18n:scan` / `i18n:build` (+ `i18n:hash -- --write` if the resolved table
   changed) and commit the regenerated files. The PR is green at the PR-tier gate; the
   release-tier gate (`I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1`) hard-fails on any `pending` row.
   - **The one PR-tier i18n exception (M16).** A new English value that is *wordy* (a run of
     4+ consecutive lowercase letters after stripping `{tokens}`, i.e. most real prose) also
     needs its five non-Latin fills (`zh_CN`/`zh_TW`/`ja_JP`/`ko_KR`/`ru_RU`) in the SAME
     change, or the always-on `tests/i18n_completeness.test.ts` reds even at PR tier: the
     build English-fills the omission, and untranslated English left byte-identical in a
     non-Latin locale is exactly the leak it catches. The maintainer normally supplies those
     five at merge; brand/URL leaves are the only ones that may stay identical.

**Catalog-domain gotcha (where to put a new client key).** Most catalog domains carry
per-locale data that `tsc` ENFORCES (locale blocks typed against the `en` shape, e.g.
`game.ts`'s `typeof gameStrings` exports), so adding a key to their `en` block red-fails `tsc`
until every non-en block is filled too. Five domains are consumed `en`-only, so an
English-only add compiles: `hud_chrome.ts`, `shell.ts`, `guide.ts`, `editor.ts`,
`api_error.ts`; their translations live solely in the overlays (`shell.ts` still carries
inline non-English blocks, but they are dead LEGACY the build never reads: reword the OVERLAY
translations, never those blocks). New HUD chrome keys go in `i18n.catalog/hud_chrome.ts`
(namespace `hudChrome.*`). **Never add `as const` to a catalog-domain object**: it narrows the
literal types and breaks the `en_XA` pseudo-locale.

**Formatters, not hand-built numbers.** Every user-visible number/date/percent/coordinate/
duration goes through `formatNumber` / `formatDateTime` / `formatMoney`. To keep English
byte-identical to a historical hand-rolled form, pass `useGrouping: false` + matching
fraction-digit options (see `coords.ts`, `meters.ts`, `xp_bar.ts`, `clock.ts`).

**Three client-side matchers re-localize `src/sim`/`server` English** (which stay
language-agnostic): the hud-local `localizeErrorText`/`localizeSystemText`/`localizeLootText`,
then `server_i18n.ts` (`localizeServerText`), then `sim_i18n.ts` (`localizeSimText`), in that
order; the S3 drift guard accepts recognition by any of the three. Dev-channel text
(`console.*`, thrown errors) stays English and is NOT matched.

**Entity & talent names** localize through their own resolvers, not raw `t()`:
`world_entity_i18n.ts` is the single ENGLISH source for mob/NPC/quest/zone/dungeon names +
narratives; `entity_i18n.ts` (`tEntity`) localizes them at runtime, with translations in the
overlays like any other key (the catalog `index.ts` merges `worldEntityText` into `en`).
Talent text NEVER touches the overlays: `tTalent` (`talent_i18n.ts`) returns the authored
English for `en`/`en_CA` and GENERATES every other locale (descriptions from effect data,
titles from the in-file dictionaries plus `talent_i18n.newlocales.ts`), so a new talent needs
no per-string translation; the `sim_i18n.ts`/`server_i18n.ts` matcher dictionaries likewise
hold their translations in-file.

## icons.ts: procedural recipes, plus a hand-authored WebP set
Most icons are composed on a canvas at runtime and cached as data URLs (no asset file).
Public API: `iconDataUrl(kind, id, size)` where `kind` is
`'ability' | 'item' | 'aura' | 'crest'`; plus `QUALITY_COLOR`. Each procedural icon is a recipe
`{ bg, pal, prims, fx? }` (`IconRecipe`) drawn over a `BACKGROUNDS` radial + `PALETTES`
tint with vector `PRIMITIVES` and optional `FX`. Unknown ids fall back via
`abilityFallback`/`itemFallback` (school + name keywords), so every id always renders.
- **Add a procedural icon for a known id:** add an entry to `ABILITY_RECIPES` / `ITEM_RECIPES` /
  `AURA_RECIPES` / `CREST_RECIPES` using the `r(bg, pal, prims, fx?)` helper (e.g.
  `r('fire','blood',['sword','flame'])`; `TL/TR/BR/BIG` are placement shorthands). New
  visuals need a new `PRIMITIVES` painter (centered at 0,0, ~100x100 space, r<=36, light top-left).
- **The exception, real painted art (WebP):** the curated `ABILITY_IMAGE_IDS` set ships image
  files instead of a recipe: `abilityImageUrl(id)` returns `/ui/skills/<class>/<id>.webp`,
  served for ability icons, aura frames, and the `/wiki` guide class pages. **The committed
  tree is WebP only and WebP is the source of truth: no PNGs.** To add one, drop the art into
  `public/ui/skills/<class>/` in any common raster format and run `npm run assets:skills`
  (`scripts/convert_skill_icons_webp.mjs`): it encodes each non-webp image to WebP (the tuned
  encoder settings live in the script) and deletes the original. Then list its id in
  `ABILITY_IMAGE_IDS`. Nothing converts at BUILD time (the script is a pre-commit step, not
  wired into `npm run build`); only `ui/skills/` is auto-converted and gated:
  `tests/skill_icons.test.ts` fails if a wired id lacks its webp or any non-webp image is
  committed there (the existing weapon JPGs and cursor/emote PNGs are grandfathered). Prefer
  WebP for any new ability/skill art.
  The Book of Deeds crest art mirrors this: the generated `DEED_IMAGE_IDS` set
  (`deed_image_ids.ts`) maps a `deed_<deedId>` crest id to `/ui/deeds/<deedId>.webp` via
  `deedImageUrl`, served for `kind:'crest'` (the deeds window; any other crest id still
  composites its procedural recipe). Convert with `npm run assets:deeds`
  (`scripts/convert_deed_icons_webp.mjs`); `tests/deed_icons.test.ts` gates the id list
  against the committed webp files in both directions.

## Small modules (pure-core + thin-consumer exemplars)
Logic lifted out of `hud.ts`: a host-agnostic core a Vitest imports directly, plus a thin
DOM/canvas consumer. EXEMPLARS only, each named for a non-obvious contract: the canonical
index is the `UI_PURE_CORES` allowlist in `tests/architecture.test.ts`, and each module's
header carries its own contract.
- **unit_portrait.ts** / **unit_portrait_painter.ts**: the canonical template pair (DOM-free
  geometry + crest-id core, thin DPR-aware painter); player and target frames share it.
- **vendor_view.ts** / **vendor_window.ts**: the first window migrated out of `hud.ts` by the
  recipe above (pure view decides the rows; thin consumer paints from injected `deps`).
- **options_view.ts** / **options_window.ts** (+ **settings_controls.ts**): the Esc options
  window. A new setting is a declarative entry in the pure model (control kind, setting key,
  label key, value coercion) painted with the shared `settings_controls.ts` builders; a
  settings refresh re-runs the painter's `render()` view dispatcher, never a direct sub-panel
  repaint.
- **window_resize.ts** (pure `window_resize_core.ts`) + **movable_frame.ts** (pure
  `target_frame_pos.ts`; `frame_pos_reset.ts`): the shared SE-corner resize grip on every
  `.window.panel` and the movable/lockable unit-frame controller, both instance-parameterized.
  Fixed-size popups opt out via `NON_RESIZABLE_WINDOW_IDS`; titlebar drag stays in `hud.ts`
  (`isWindowDragHandle`); bump `LAYOUT_RESET_EPOCH` only for a forced one-time frame-position
  reset.
- **deeds_view.ts** / **deeds_window.ts** (+ **deed_tracker_painter.ts**,
  **deeds_leaderboard_view.ts**, **deed_i18n.ts**, **deed_i18n.locales/**,
  **deed_image_ids.ts**): the Book of Deeds achievements window. The DOM-free core builds
  the category/entry model, search, progress fractions, crest-id resolution, and the
  drain-batched unlock moment (banners coalesce, retro grants fold to one summary line);
  the painter is a cold window plus the write-elided HUD watch tracker. `deed_i18n.ts`
  re-localizes deed names/descriptions/titles/broadcast lines from ids (the
  `talent_i18n.ts` entity-style pattern; per-base-locale release-fill chunks under
  `deed_i18n.locales/` fetched lazily via `DEED_LOCALE_LOADERS`);
  `deeds_leaderboard_view.ts` is the Renown-board tab's pure core.
- **bank_filter.ts** (with **bank_view.ts** / **bank_window.ts**): the bank search/sort
  preserves live `slotIndex` values verbatim, so a filtered row still names the exact wire
  argument for deposit/withdraw.
