// Deeds records: an OBSERVER of the sim's deedUnlocked events, never an
// authority. The sim alone decides unlocks (src/sim/deeds.ts grantDeed) and
// persists them inside the characters.state blob; this module only mirrors
// each unlock into the queryable character_deeds index. It copies the
// bank_ledger runtime shape minus the diffing (deeds are event-driven, so
// there is no before/after snapshot to compare): each insert chains onto a
// per-process FIFO promise tail the game loop NEVER awaits, a rejected insert
// logs and never blocks or reorders anything, and the whole body is guarded
// so the observer can never throw into the caller. Idempotence lives in the
// SQL (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING over UNIQUE (character_id, deed_id)), so retro
// re-emits on every login and crash-replays are free.
