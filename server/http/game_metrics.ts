// The game-state half of the /metrics exporter: the live game signals that are
// already measured in-memory by GameServer (players/accounts/ws connections online,
// sim entity count, achieved sim Hz, per-phase loop timing) plus the three
// throughput counters (ws frames, chat messages, characters created), all
// registered on the SAME prom-client registry the RED exporter builds
// (server/http/metrics.ts). Prometheus attaches env / service=game / server_name at
// scrape time, so nothing here emits those.
//
// GAUGES ARE READ AT SCRAPE TIME, NO DRIFT. Each gauge carries a collect() that
// pulls the current value from the injected GameStateSource the moment
// registry.metrics() runs, so a scrape always reflects live state and the game loop
// never has to push a sample. COUNTERS are pushed from their emission sites through
// the process-wide slot in server/http/game_signals.ts (installed by main.ts at
// boot with the sink this function returns), exactly like the attack-signal counters.
//
// CARDINALITY IS BOUNDED BY DESIGN, same contract as server/http/metrics.ts: the
// only label values are the fixed tick-phase names, the two per-phase stats
// (p95, max), and the two ws directions (in, out). Nothing per-player (account id,
// character id, name, ip) is ever a label. The tick-phase series count is fixed at
// WOC_TICK_PHASES.length * 2, independent of the profiler's internal phase set.
