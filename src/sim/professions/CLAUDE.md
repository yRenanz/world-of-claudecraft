# src/sim/professions/: profession mechanics

The mechanics home for gathering, crafting, enchanting, salvage, and the
archetype identity system. Every module here is host-agnostic sim logic behind
the `SimContext` seam (`src/sim/sim_context.ts`): functions taking `(ctx, ...)`
or pure leaves, never a `Sim` import, randomness only via `ctx.rng` (guarded by
`tests/architecture.test.ts`). The data tables live in `src/sim/content/`
(`professions.ts`, `recipes.ts`, `gather_nodes.ts`, `enchants.ts`), never here.

## Module map (mechanic owners; `ls src/sim/professions/` for the live set)
- `gathering.ts`: gathering proficiency + node harvest (`harvestNode`/
  `resolveHarvest`, `NODE_HARVEST_TABLE`, the `rollMaterialRarity` rarity
  ladder). Node respawn is per VIEWER: two players can see the same node
  differently.
- `wheel.ts`: flat per-craft skills (`CraftSkills`, `gainCraftSkill`,
  `tierForSkill`/`tierCapability`, perk-eligibility reads).
- `crafting.ts`: `craftItem`/`resolveCraft` (all-or-nothing reagent consume,
  quality roll clamped to the archetype ceiling, skill gain, recipe acquisition).
- `archetype.ts`: the active-archetype state machine (`ArchetypeState`,
  `archetypeCeilingFor`/`craftCeiling`, `getHobbyCraft`, amends-gated switching).
- `enchanting.ts` / `salvage.ts`: disenchant + apply an enchant onto a SPECIFIC
  instanced copy (`ItemInstancePayload`); break items back into materials
  (off-wheel, ungated).
- `tools.ts` / `crafting_hub.ts` / `focus.ts` / `mobile_station.ts`: pure-leaf
  gates and bonuses (gather-tool tier, level-20 hub, town focus allocation,
  field crafting station).
- `profession_xp.ts` / `battlefield_xp.ts`: character-XP curves for gather/craft
  actions; the crafted-item attribution XP trickle.
- `types.ts`: the shared record shapes. `index.ts` is a types-only barrel; the
  logic modules are imported per-module by path (see the imports in `sim.ts`).

## Where a new profession mechanic lands
1. Its own small module here taking `SimContext`; never import `Sim`, never a
   new method cluster on `sim.ts`.
2. Backing state as `PlayerMeta` fields initialized in `addPlayer` (`sim.ts`),
   persisted as OPTIONAL `CharacterState` fields with defaults so pre-feature
   saves load cleanly (the pattern every existing field follows:
   `gatheringProficiency`, `craftSkills`, `knownRecipes`, `archetype`).
3. Data tables in `src/sim/content/`, never in the module.
4. Reads/actions: extend `IWorldProfessions` (`src/world_api/professions.ts`)
   FIRST, then implement in BOTH `Sim` and `ClientWorld` (root "IWorld is the
   only seam" rule).
5. A test in `tests/professions_<thing>.test.ts` (exemplars:
   `tests/professions_crafting.test.ts`, `tests/gather_node_harvest.test.ts`).
   Bug fix rule: a failing test that reproduces the bug first, then the
   smallest change that turns it green.

## Balance invariants (settled; do not re-litigate)
- All ten craft skills are independent, purely ADDITIVE counters (`wheel.ts`):
  no conserved pool, never drain one craft to raise another. Gathering
  proficiencies are additive the same way (`gathering.ts`).
- Archetype identity is a ring-adjacent PAIR of majors (`activeArchetype` +
  `pairedMajor`, uncapped) plus a hobby (the opposite craft on `CRAFT_RING`,
  capped at rare); every other craft caps at common once an archetype is set,
  and everything caps at rare before one is set (`archetype.ts`
  `archetypeCeilingFor`).
- The ceiling freezes EMPOWERMENT, never the raw-capability climb: output
  quality is clamped to the ceiling and a recipe tiered ABOVE the ceiling
  grants zero skill, but at or below the ceiling the ordinary progress curve
  runs off raw capability unchanged (`crafting.ts` `resolveCraft`; pinned by
  `tests/archetype_ceiling.test.ts` and `tests/professions_skill.test.ts`).

## Wire + persistence names (settled)
- Snapshot deltas: `prof` (the `professionsState` view) and `gprof`
  (`gatheringProficiency`), diff-sent; the terse-key maps and `ALL_DELTA_KEYS`
  are pinned in `tests/snapshots.test.ts`.
- Persistence (JSONB on the character save row, `server/db.ts`):
  `gatheringProficiency` is the current key (preferred on read, always
  written); `professions` is the legacy pre-rename key, still dual-written on
  every save for downgrade back-compat and read only as a fallback when
  `gatheringProficiency` is absent. Craft-side state persists as separate optional `CharacterState`
  fields (`craftSkills`, `knownRecipes`, `archetype`, `equipmentInstance` for
  enchanted copies); see the comments on `CharacterState` in `sim.ts`.
- The facet's member list is pinned by `tests/world_api_parity.test.ts`
  (`FACET_PROFESSIONS`) and exercised by `tests/professions_contracts.test.ts`;
  keep counts out of prose.
