// P18d item 6: the pre-game $WOC wallet picker routes through the ONE shared FocusManager
// (src/ui/focus_manager), not a second hand-rolled focus trap (the P15a single-FocusManager
// invariant). src/main.ts is the whole client entry (it boots the app on import, far too
// heavy for a Node test), so this pins the unification by source-grep: the old ad-hoc trap is
// gone and the shared manager is used. The trap WIRING itself (the Tab/Shift+Tab cycle,
// focus-first-skip-close, return-to-opener, the do-not-trap-from-the-game-world guard) is
// covered behaviorally by tests/focus_manager.test.ts; a bare vitest run stays browser-free,
// so the real-browser keyboard E2E over this modal is out of scope here.
