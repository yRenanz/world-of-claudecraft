// Pure derivation for the unit_frame FAMILY: ONE allocation-light core + ONE write-elided painter
// (unit_frame_painter.ts) that a player, target, or party instance all drive.
// The core maps a UNIT DESCRIPTOR (the values a frame needs, computed at the call
// site) to a UNIT VIEW (the values the painter writes). It has NO hardcoded
// element id and NO single-instance assumption: it is a pure function of the
// descriptor, so the same descriptor always yields the same view (DOM-free,
// i18n-free, no Math.random / Date.now / performance.now). The player frame is the
// FIRST instance through this seam; target and party are added as further
// instances of the EXACT seam with no core change, so the descriptor deliberately
// carries the FULL field set target and party need even though the player leaves
// some at their always-present values.
//
// What the core actually computes (the rest is a typed pass-through that pins the
// contract): the present/hidden gate (a unit may be absent), the absorb-shield
// overlay via the shared absorbBarView core (so player/target/party never
// re-derive it), and the resource-type DISCRIMINATOR (which also folds the player
// block's `rage : energy : mana` ternary and adds the `none` case a target frame
// with no resource bar needs). Health/resource fractions and the hp/resource TEXT
// are preformatted at the call site (allocation-light: no raw entity references,
// no per-element garbage), exactly as the inline player block computed them.
