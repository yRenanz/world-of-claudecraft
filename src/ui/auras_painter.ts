// The keyed-pool aura-strip painter (v0.16.0). It
// replaces the old renderAuras `__sig` cache + innerHTML wipe + per-rebuild
// attachTooltip (state.md Top risk 3) with a persistent per-aura node pool: one node
// per aura key (the aura id), reused across frames, its tooltip attached ONCE and
// reading a LIVE mutable record, data updated IN PLACE through the host's elided
// writers. Same painter, two instances: the player buff bar
// (#buff-bar) and the target strip (#tf-debuffs, mode 'all': buffs AND debuffs).
//
// TOP RISK 3 (the load-bearing correctness rule): the pooled record is a MUTABLE
// object. The tooltip closure attaches ONCE per node and reads `rec.name` / `rec.remaining`
// LIVE, never a captured aura value. Capture-by-value would go stale the moment the
// pool recycles that node to a different aura (the node would show the previous aura's
// name). So a recycle (aura A leaves, aura B reuses A's node) updates the record's
// fields and the same closure renders B. tests/auras_painter.test.ts pins this with a
// recycle A->B regression.
//
// WRITE ROUTING: every per-frame DOM write goes through
// the writer facet (setStyleProp for the icon, toggleClass for the debuff class,
// setText for the duration + stacks, setDisplay for the stacks badge visibility); no
// raw style / textContent / className / setAttribute. The only DOM construction (the
// node + its children) happens once per pooled node in createNode(); the icon data-URL
// is resolved only when an aura's icon key changes (the expensive part).
//
// ORDER: the active records are reconciled into the container with the minimum number
// of node moves (the reconcileOrder discipline), so a steady-state frame moves no
// nodes. The buff bar is `flex-wrap` row-reverse, so DOM order is the aura order.
