// Common-tier crafting resolution (issue #1127). Behind the SimContext seam:
// checks a player has every reagent a recipe requires, consumes them (denying
// and consuming NOTHING if any reagent is short), rolls the output's quality
// via the shared material-rarity ladder (rollMaterialRarity, keyed on the
// player's craft skill for this recipe's craft rather than gathering
// proficiency: same ladder, different "power" input, exactly the reuse the
// gathering.ts comment on that function invites), grants the resulting item,
// and grants a flat point of craft skill (see wheel.ts: additive-only,
// free-floor).
//
// Scope: COMMON TIER ONLY (skillReq 0 on every recipe in content/recipes.ts).
// Higher-tier gating, the wheel, and archetype-exclusive combos are later
// issues; this module resolves exactly the common-tier path end to end.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/
// game/net imports, no Math.random/Date.now, host-agnostic so it runs
// offline, on the server, and in the headless RL env unchanged.
