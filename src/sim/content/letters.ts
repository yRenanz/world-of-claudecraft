// select quests send after their turn-in. Data-as-code, merged nowhere: the
// PostOffice (src/sim/mail/post_office.ts) reads these tables directly.
//
// English here is the source of truth; the client localizes each letter by its
// stable `letterId` through the entity dictionary (src/ui/entity_i18n.ts kind
// 'letter', sourced from src/ui/world_entity_i18n.ts). Keep ids append-only: a delivered
// letter persists in the mail JSONB with its letterId, so renaming one orphans
// the localized copy of every letter already sitting in a mailbox.
