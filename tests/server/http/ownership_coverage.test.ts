// Registry-wide DENY-BY-DEFAULT functional coverage gate for the BOLA
// requireOwned seam.
//
// tests/server/http/completeness.test.ts already asserts the METADATA marker:
// checkRequireOwnedCoverage([...apiRoutes]) is empty, so every account-owned :id
// route DECLARES meta.requireOwned { ownerScope: 'account' }. That is a static
// promise about the route table, not about what the route actually DOES.
//
// This file adds the functional guarantee the metadata cannot give: that every
// account-owned :id route in the registry actually MOUNTS an account-scoped owner
// loader that DENIES a non-owned / absent id with a 404 (deny-by-default), before
// the handler's success body is ever produced. It is the load-bearing BOLA
// coverage test the packet leans on: a route that carried the marker but forgot to
// mount requireOwnedCharacter would ship a cross-account read hole that the
// metadata check waves through; this sweep turns that into a red test.
//
// How it works: the account db seam is driven with a fake whose getCharacter
// ALWAYS returns null (the deny path: no owned row for the caller), the auth guard
// is satisfied with a valid full-scope bearer, and each route's real middleware
// chain is run via compose(). A route with the loader mounted answers the player-
// owned 404 and never reaches its handler; a route missing the loader would fall
// through to its 200 handler, which the negative control proves the sweep detects.
