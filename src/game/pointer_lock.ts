// Pure decision logic for engaging/releasing the pointer lock used by mouse
// camera rotation. Kept DOM-free so it unit-tests in isolation (the same
// pattern as click_move.ts / pointer_pick.ts).
//
// Why this exists: camera rotation integrates relative mouse deltas
// (movementX/movementY). Without pointer lock the OS cursor is free to leave
// the window, so it hits the monitor edge (movementX clamps to 0, the camera
// freezes) or slips onto a second display. Locking the pointer while a drag is
// active keeps every delta flowing and the cursor pinned to the canvas.
