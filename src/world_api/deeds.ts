// The Book of Deeds (the deeds system): the SELF player's earned deeds,
// persisted lifetime stat block, Renown total, and displayed title, plus the
// global rarity read. The four data reads mirror sim state the evaluator
// (src/sim/deeds.ts) maintains; the one command requests a title change,
// which the sim validates (the deed must be earned and carry a title reward;
// null clears; invalid input is a silent no-op). Offline the Sim exposes its
// live per-player state (the questLog precedent); online the ClientWorld
// mirrors the snapshot self keys (`deeds`/`dstats` heavy-gated,
// `renown`/`atitle` per-tick diffed) and the `deedUnlocked` event stays
// presentation-only. Other players' titles are not here: they ride the entity
// wire (`title`, a deed id) for nameplates/inspect.
