# World of ClaudeCraft

A classic-style micro-MMO **and** a headless reinforcement-learning
environment, both driven by one deterministic TypeScript simulation core.
Stack: TypeScript (ESM, `strict`) · Three.js renderer · `ws` WebSockets ·
Postgres (`pg`) · Vite + esbuild · Vitest. No UI framework in the game client; tiny
dependency set. The one sanctioned exception is the standalone admin dashboard
(`src/admin/`), which is built with Svelte 5 (it never touches the game client bundle).

## Repo map
| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/sim/` | **Deterministic game core, the source of truth.** No DOM/Three deps; runs in browser, server, and headless. |
| `src/sim/content/` | Data-as-code: the 9 classes, abilities, zones, dungeons, items, talents. |
| `src/render/` | Three.js renderer (procedural geometry/textures/VFX). Reads the world; never mutates it. |
| `src/game/` | Local input, camera, keybinds, mobile controls, procedural WebAudio. |
| `src/ui/` | Classic HUD (frames, windows, tooltips, map, FCT), procedural icons, i18n. |
| `src/styles/` | Extracted HUD CSS (`tokens`/`base`/`layout`/`components`/`hud`/`hud.mobile` plus per-entry `.extra`) under one `@layer` order, imported once from the game entries via `src/main.ts`. See `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`. |
| `src/net/` | Online client: REST auth + WebSocket world mirror (`ClientWorld`). |
| `src/admin/` | Admin dashboard SPA (separate `admin.html` entry). |
| `src/guide/` | Public guide/wiki SPA (separate `guide.html` entry, served at `/wiki`); spoiler-safe content generated from `src/sim/`. |
| `src/world_api.ts` | `IWorld`, the seam render/ui depend on (see Architecture). |
| `src/main.ts` | Client entry; fixes the world seed. |
| `server/` | Authoritative game server: HTTP+WS, world loop, Postgres, auth, social, moderation. |
| `server/http/` | The REST request pipeline spine: table router, middleware onion, per-domain `RouteDef` tables, typed schemas, stable error codes. |
| `headless/` + `python/` | RL env server (`env_server.ts`) + Python Gym bindings. |
| `tests/` | Vitest suite. |
| `scripts/` | Asset build + browser E2E / screenshot / integration scripts (`.mjs`). |
| `public/` · `docs/` | Static assets (GLB models / textures / HDRIs) · design + PRD docs. |

Most directories above have their own `CLAUDE.md` with local conventions; read it when you work there.

## Commands
- `npm run dev`: Vite client on :5173 (proxies `/api`, `/admin/api`, `/ws` to :8787).
- `npm run server`: esbuild-bundle + run the authoritative server on :8787.
- `npm test`: Vitest. **Prefer a single file while iterating:** `npx vitest run tests/sim.test.ts`.
- `npm run gate`: the full CI-equivalent pre-merge gate (i18n gen + freshness, malware scan,
  changed-files biome, full tests with bounded workers, `tsc`, all builds; release-tier
  automatically on a `release/**` branch). Exit-code-safe; use it instead of an ad-hoc `&&` chain
  before calling a change done (piping `npm test` through `tail` masks its exit code, and an
  unbounded run flakes heavy suites under core contention).
- `npm run build`: generate media manifest, then `vite build`, then emit manifest. Five entries (game, admin, play, guide, editor).
- `npm run env` / `npm run bench`: build + run the headless RL env server.
- `npm run db:up` / `npm run db:down`: Postgres 16 in Docker (dev DB on :5433).
- `npm run realms`: run multiple realm processes locally.

See `README.md` for the full host/develop/play guide and the classic-fidelity checklist; `DEPLOY.md` for production.

## Architecture (the load-bearing ideas)
- **One sim, three hosts.** The exact same `src/sim/` code runs the offline
  browser world, the online server, and the RL env. Behavior must be identical
  everywhere; that is the whole point.
- **`IWorld` is the only seam.** `src/world_api.ts` defines `IWorld`; the offline
  `Sim` satisfies it structurally and the online `ClientWorld` implements it by
  mirroring server snapshots. **`src/render/` and `src/ui/` talk only to `IWorld`**,
  never to `Sim`/`ClientWorld` concretely. New feature: extend `IWorld` first,
  then implement it in both worlds.
- **The server is authoritative.** Clients stream movement intent + commands at
  20 Hz; the server runs the one shared `Sim` and returns interest-scoped
  (~120 yd) snapshots + per-player events. All combat, loot, quest credit, and
  economy resolve server-side. The client is a renderer; it never decides outcomes.
  REST requests run through the in-house pipeline seam (`server/http/`): a new endpoint is a
  `RouteDef` module behind the registry, never an inline route in `main.ts` (see `server/http/CLAUDE.md`).

## Invariants, YOU MUST keep these
- **`src/sim/` has zero DOM/browser/Three.js imports** and never imports from
  `render/`, `ui/`, `game/`, or `net/`. It must run unchanged in Node and the
  browser. (Guarded by `tests/architecture.test.ts`, which scans every sim file.)
- **Determinism.** The sim is a fixed **20 Hz** tick (`DT = 1/20`). All randomness
  goes through `Rng` (`src/sim/rng.ts`): **never `Math.random`**, `Date.now`, or
  `performance.now` in sim logic. Same seed gives the same world. (Also guarded by
  `tests/architecture.test.ts`.)
- **Gameplay math follows real classic-era MMO formulas** (rage, hit tables, armor DR,
  XP curves; see `README.md` and `docs/design/`). Don't invent balance numbers.
- **Graphics and performance settings are gameplay-neutral.** No preset or tier knob (the
  static `data-fx-level`, reduce-motion, the FPS governor) may confer a gameplay advantage or
  disadvantage. A tier may shed COSMETIC richness (FCT volume/lifetime, redraw smoothness, icon
  overflow within about 200ms) but NEVER actionable information a player reacts to: own debuffs,
  party/raid HP, the target/boss cast bar, target HP granularity, enemy/aggro positions. Tier
  knobs read the STATIC preset via `src/game/ui_effects_profile.ts`, never the governor. Rule of
  thumb: if it hides or delays something a player acts on, it is not allowed. Exemplars and the
  fairness tests: `src/ui/CLAUDE.md` + `docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md`.
- **Don't hand-edit generated files**, e.g. `src/render/assets/manifest.generated.ts`
  (regenerate via the build).
- **i18n: every player-visible string is a `t()` key**, classified by render sink,
  not statement type. In scope: labels, tooltips, placeholders, aria/alt, toasts,
  dialogs, validation and "connection lost" errors, static HTML, `document.title`,
  server-sent player text, and the whole admin dashboard (operators are users). The
  final rendered text always comes from `t()`, never concat, `?? 'English'`
  fallbacks, default params, or `setAttribute('aria-label'|'title'|...)`. Out of
  scope (English only): dev-channel text (`console.*`, assertions, a `throw` no catch
  surfaces); if one string feeds both a log and the UI, split it. Numbers, money,
  dates, and percents go through `formatNumber`/`formatDateTime`/`formatMoney`/`Intl`.
  - **Contributors add ENGLISH only; the maintainer fills every locale at release.**
    Add the key to `en` (the matching `src/ui/i18n.catalog/<domain>.ts` module) and
    render it via `t()`. Never edit the `src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` overlays, and
    never put English, a placeholder, or a `// TODO` into one. The build English-fills
    omissions (registry marks them `pending`): the PR-tier gate permits English-only (the one
    exception, M16: a new *wordy* English value also needs its five non-Latin fills in the same
    change, see `src/ui/CLAUDE.md`), the release-tier gate (`I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1`) hard-fails on
    any `pending` row.
  - **`src/sim/` and `server/` stay language-agnostic** (no `t()`, no DOM) but their
    player text is in scope: emit a stable key plus values, or English re-localized
    via the client matcher (`src/ui/sim_i18n.ts` + `server_i18n.ts`) in the SAME
    change. The S3 guard (`tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`) enforces it.
  - Full model (catalog layout, the `hud_chrome` English-only exception, formatters,
    matcher rules): `src/ui/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md`.
- **Never set `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS=1` in production** (it enables level/teleport/item cheats).
- **Never commit `.env` or secrets.**

## Conventions
- **ESM + TypeScript `strict`** everywhere. 2-space indent; match the surrounding file.
- **Keep the dependency set tiny.** Don't add packages without a clear need. (Svelte
  and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` are the one sanctioned exception, scoped to the
  `src/admin/` dashboard bundle; the game/guide/play entries stay framework-free.)
- **No em dashes, en dashes, or emojis** anywhere: code, comments, docs, commits, PR
  text, or player-facing copy. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or "to" for ranges.
  (An emoji that stands in for a real label still needs its real `t()` text.)
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits with a scope (`feat(talents): ...`, `fix(net): ...`,
  `test(sim): ...`). Branches: `feature/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`.

## Modularity, module-first for new code (read before touching a big file)
The four logic monoliths (`src/ui/hud.ts` ~10k, `src/sim/sim.ts` ~7.5k, `src/main.ts` ~6.4k,
`src/render/renderer.ts` ~4.5k) are coordinators, not a license to grow them. They are ACTIVE
extraction targets (the `SimContext` campaign has already lifted ~12k lines of game systems out
of `Sim`), so the rule is: never GROW one. Do NOT split a coordinator just to hit a line count,
but every NEW self-contained behavior lands as its own small, tested module behind an existing
seam, not as another method cluster or banner section. The deciding question is one: **does this
code need the coordinator's private mutable state** (the live `Sim` loop, the `Hud` DOM and
per-frame buffers, the renderer's scene graph)? If no, it is a sibling module, every time. If
only partly, extract the pure part (math, formatting, id/state resolution) into a host-agnostic
module a Vitest imports directly and leave the coordinator a thin consumer.
- **`src/main.ts` is a firewall, not a home.** Client-bootstrap helpers (mobile, fullscreen,
  shell, loading, analytics, graphics detection) belong in `src/game/` or `src/ui/` sibling
  modules. It is the one monolith with no seam and still accreting; never add a top-level
  function here when a sibling module will do.
- **Data-as-code is exempt.** Large declarative tables (`src/sim/content/*`,
  `src/ui/i18n.catalog/*`, `talent_i18n.ts`, `sim_i18n.ts`) are correctly big; module-first is
  about LOGIC, never data. Do not "modularize" a data table.
Use the seams this repo already has, do not invent new ones:
- New render/ui feature: extend `IWorld` (`src/world_api.ts`) first, implement in BOTH
  `Sim` and `ClientWorld`, then consume via `IWorld`. render/ui never import a concrete world.
- New HUD component (a self-contained window OR a per-frame frame/bar): its own module the
  HUD composes, never a new banner section in `hud.ts`. A pure view-core
  (`src/ui/<name>_view.ts`, DOM/Three-free, Node-tested, in the `UI_PURE_CORES` allowlist)
  plus a thin write-elided painter on the `PainterHost` seam (`src/ui/painter_host.ts`),
  INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED (take a descriptor/id, no hardcoded element id). Reuse a FAMILY
  before bespoke (a unit-style frame is a `UnitFramePainter`; an extra action bar a new
  `ActionBarPainter(descriptor)`). The full recipe, the `*_view` completeness scan, the
  per-frame perf floor, and the a11y / token / canvas contracts live in `src/ui/CLAUDE.md`
  + `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.
- New visual system: a new `src/render/<thing>.ts` the renderer calls, not a method bank on `renderer.ts`.
- New sim SYSTEM behavior (a combat/mob/social/economy mechanic, not just a data record):
  its own module behind the `SimContext` seam (`src/sim/sim_context.ts`), with backing
  state kept on `Sim` as a live `ctx` view, never a new method cluster on the `sim.ts`
  coordinator. See `src/sim/CLAUDE.md`.
- New game content (mob/quest/item/ability/zone): a declarative record in
  `src/sim/content/`, merged by `data.ts`, never a content table inline in `sim.ts`.
  Player-facing content also feeds the `/wiki` guide: run `npm run wiki:content` (auto in
  `pretest`/`build`, freshness-gated by `tests/guide.test.ts`) and add any new `guide.*`
  prose keys (see `src/guide/CLAUDE.md`).
- New server REST endpoint: a `RouteDef` module (`server/<domain>.ts` `export const routes`)
  registered in `server/http/registry.ts`, never an inline handler in `main.ts`. Scaffold with
  `npm run new:endpoint` (see `server/http/CLAUDE.md`).
- New multi-file subsystem: a directory with an `index.ts` barrel exposing only its
  public surface (templates: `src/render/characters/`, `src/ui/i18n.catalog/`), plus a local `CLAUDE.md`.

Extract on the rule of three, not before: leave two similar blocks alone; a third copy,
or one block with a single nameable responsibility, earns its own module. Never abstract
for one use or a hypothetical future need (the pure-core + thin-consumer reference is
`src/ui/unit_portrait.ts` + `unit_portrait_painter.ts`). Fix bugs test-first: a failing
test that reproduces the bug, then the smallest change that turns it green. Detailed
heuristics and the bug-fix workflow live in the `extract-and-test` skill
(`.claude/skills/extract-and-test/`).

## Testing & verification
- Logic/unit: Vitest (`tests/`). Add or update tests when you change sim or server behavior.
- E2E/visual: `scripts/*.mjs` drive real browsers via `puppeteer-core` and need
  `npm run dev` (often `npm run server` too) running. Bot raids / E2E that teleport
  or level need `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS=1` (dev only).
- **QA gate before a change is done.** Run `/qa` (or invoke the `qa-checklist` agent) over your
  diff: it checks every invariant in play, names the domain reviewers to dispatch, and ends with
  an adversarial "what is missing" pass. Two checked-in hooks enforce the cheap floor so it is
  never skipped: a `Stop` hook (`.claude/hooks/qa-stop.sh`) blocks instantly on an em/en dash,
  emoji, stray `.only(`, or `debugger`; the `.githooks/pre-push` floor runs `tsc`, the guard
  tests, biome, and the copy scan at push time. See `docs/qa-gate.md` and `.claude/hooks/README.md`.
- **Biome / formatting / CI.** Biome 2.5.0 (`biome.json`: 2-space, lineWidth 100, single quotes,
  trailing commas). CI and the pre-push floor gate CHANGED FILES ONLY (`npm run ci:changed` =
  `biome ci --changed`) and fail on errors and format diffs, NOT on lint warnings. Whole-repo
  `biome check .` is intentionally RED (~1000+ pre-existing issues): a DEFERRED chore, not your
  regression, do not fix it. NEVER run a whole-repo `--write` (`check:fix`/`format`/`lint:fix`,
  or `biome ... .`); it reformats a monolith into a huge unrelated diff. Format only the files
  you changed: `npx @biomejs/biome check --write <changed-file.ts>`.

## Working style and effort by model
This whole file is the baseline for **any** model: obey all of it. Your active model is
named in your system prompt ("You are powered by the model named ... model ID ..."). The
block below changes only how much you take on at once and at what effort, never what is
correct.
- **Baseline (Sonnet 4.6, any model, and the default whenever you are unsure):** take
  small, verifiable steps; checkpoint with the user before large multi-file changes; use
  one investigation subagent for a broad search rather than fanning out widely. Effort:
  medium by default, low for latency-sensitive trivia, high for hard reasoning.
- **Opus 4.8 only (model ID `claude-opus-4-8`):** work autonomously. Plan multi-step work
  end to end and carry long-horizon tasks (migrations, multi-file refactors) to completion
  without pausing after each step, as long as the build and tests stay green. Front-load
  the spec: state the task, intent, constraints, and the acceptance check in one turn
  rather than revealing them piecemeal. Effort: `xhigh` is the recommended start for coding
  and agentic work, `high` the minimum for intelligence-sensitive work; reserve `max` for
  genuinely frontier problems and measure, since it overthinks and oscillates on structured
  tasks. (4.8 recalibrated the levels: `high` thinks somewhat less and `xhigh` substantially
  more than 4.7, so re-baseline if you tuned against 4.7.) The operator can push further with
  ultracode (`xhigh` plus deterministic Workflow fan-out).
- **Fan out, and review for coverage (Opus 4.8):** 4.8 under-spawns by default, so
  explicitly fan out parallel subagents across independent files, subsystems, or batch
  items; do not spawn for work doable in one response. Before declaring done, have a fresh
  subagent review your own diff: its job is COVERAGE (report every correctness or
  requirement gap with confidence and severity), not filtering, which happens in a later
  pass. The repo ships purpose-built reviewers in `.claude/agents/` (dispatch via `/qa`):
  `qa-checklist` (the end-of-contribution gate), `architecture-reviewer` (determinism + the
  `SimContext` seam for `src/sim/`), `cross-platform-sync`, `migration-safety`,
  `privacy-security-review`, `test-coverage-auditor` (assertion decisiveness + pin quality),
  and the `release-malware-audit` release gate; plus the `feature-plan`, `extract-and-test`,
  and `release-merge-audit` (after any release merge into a feature branch) skills. Prefer
  those over ad-hoc subagents.
- **State rule scope literally.** 4.8 follows instructions literally and will not
  generalize a rule across cases unless told. When an invariant covers every case (every
  player string is a `t()` key; all sim randomness goes through `Rng`), say "every" or
  "all"; do not rely on generalization by analogy.
- **Never gate the Invariants, safety (`ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS`, secrets), or correctness on
  which model you are:** the identity line can be stale, so when in doubt use the
  baseline. Anchor every autonomous step on a check you can actually run (`npx vitest run
  <file>`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `tests/architecture.test.ts`, the S3 i18n guard
  `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`), never on "looks done."
