// item-shape helpers, so it is Vitest-importable directly (like
// threat.ts/spatial.ts).
//
// This repo has no durability mechanic anywhere in ItemDef (see types.ts):
// a base gathering tool never carries a durability field, so it can never
// become unusable from durability loss. That is a property of the item shape,

// long before this base and would drag in an unrelated inventory model for a
// bonus this module can track on its own). A slot is plain data the caller
// (a future per-tool-instance record, e.g. keyed by playerId+professionId, or
// a per-node harvest call site) owns and passes in; this module never stores
// slot state itself, keeping it a pure leaf like the rest of the file.

// outcome-producing function should: build the base HarvestOutcome, then
// call `resolveToolEffectUse(slot, outcome, toolRarity, targetRarity, rng,
// confirmed)` using the SAME `Rng` the caller already draws from (never a
// fresh one) so the depletion roll (when it fires) takes its place in the one
// shared draw order. `confirmed` should come from the player's client request
// for a 'prompt' slot (see the tool/effect UI toggle); a caller with no
// confirmation flow yet can pass `true` unconditionally, which is equivalent
// to every slot behaving as 'always'.
