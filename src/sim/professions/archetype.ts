// Active-archetype state and quest-gated switching (issue #1129, superseded scope).
//
// Per the #107 decision (see the maintainer comment on #1129), the conserved-mass
// budget / opposite-craft-drain model this issue originally described was dropped.
// Knowledge in all ten crafts (see wheel.ts) stays flat and purely additive: this
// module never reads or writes CraftSkills, and archetype selection/switching NEVER
// touches any craft skill value. Archetype identity instead comes from a single
// "active archetype" field: one of the ten crafts on the ring (content/professions.ts)
// a character has declared as their identity. It starts unset (null).
//
// The active archetype is set for the first time by a zone-1 acceptance lore quest,
// and can only be changed afterward by first completing a repeatable, escalating
// "make amends" quest. Each successful switch increments a persisted per-character
// switchCount, and the amount of amends-quest progress required to switch again
// scales with that count (see requiredAmendsProgress below).
//
// STUB, documented explicitly: this module implements the full state machine (the
// interesting, testable logic), but the two quests themselves are content stubs.
// Real quest giver/turn-in NPC placement and dialogue authoring for a zone-1 lore
// quest, plus a genuinely repeatable turn-in flow (the existing quest engine in
// src/sim/quests/ is one-time only: turnInQuestCore adds the quest id to
// `questsDone` and there is no re-accept path), are out of scope for this change.
// Instead, acceptArchetypeQuest/advanceAmendsProgress are the direct entry points a
// (future) quest-completion hook calls; see content/zone1.ts for the placeholder
// QuestDef records these stand in for.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/game/net
// imports, no Math.random/Date.now, host-agnostic so it runs offline, on the
// server, and in the headless RL env unchanged.

// already uniquely identifies which title is granted. Keeping this an identifier
// (never localized English prose) matches the "IWorld is a string-free seam" rule
// (src/CLAUDE.md): the actual title WORDS are English-source, localized-at-client
