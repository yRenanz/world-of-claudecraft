# API Pipeline Re-Architecture: planning packet

This packet re-architects every JSON endpoint on the authoritative game server (`server/`)
behind one in-house request pipeline. The goal is maintainability, security, testability,
and observability, not concurrency scaling (the single-threaded 20 Hz world loop is the
real per-realm ceiling and is a separate, out-of-scope workstream), not a gameplay change,
and not a WebSocket wire change. No heavy web framework, zero new runtime dependencies (the
one weighed exception is `prom-client`, and only when the `/metrics` exporter lands in Phase
23). Delivery is a stacked PR chain: 26 implementation phases (25 planned plus the 18b
late-arrivals insert), each paired with a QA phase, each its own green and bisectable PR
that keeps the suite green at every commit and stays under a roughly 40%-context-per-phase
bound. The new pipeline sits in front of the old ladders via per-path catch-all delegates
(four flag-gated dispatchers as of Phase 18: /api, /admin/api, /oauth, and /internal, whose
delegate is the composite that tries the daily-rewards ops sub-dispatcher first) so
partially migrated states stay correct, and the old ladders are retained until Phase 25
names the metric exit criteria for their deletion in a later release. Route families that
arrive via release merges AFTER their would-have-been migration wave (github at v0.18.0;
desktop-login and daily-rewards at v0.19.0) are owned by Phase 18b, which must land before
Phase 25's deletion (and ideally before Phase 19's limiter rework).

## Start here (cross-phase docs)

Read these before opening any single phase. They are the shared context every phase file
assumes.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [brainstorm.md](brainstorm.md) | The raw option exploration and trade-off reasoning behind the locked decisions. |
| [implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md) | The end-to-end plan: phase sequencing, the stacked-PR delivery model, and the locked architecture. |
| [progress.md](progress.md) | Running progress log across phases (what has shipped, what is in flight). |
| [state.md](state.md) | Current execution state: the active phase and any open questions or carryover. |
| [qa-checklist.md](qa-checklist.md) | The shared QA checklist each `phase-NN-qa.md` instantiates against its diff. |
| [source-spec.md](source-spec.md) | The originating SPEC this packet decomposes. Its `main.ts`/`db.ts` line anchors are stale; re-anchor on symbol names. |

## Phase index (ordered)

Each implementation phase `phase-NN-<slug>.md` is paired with its QA phase `phase-NN-qa.md`.
Work them in order: a phase depends on the spine and harness the earlier phases land. The
`ctx` column is the synthesis context-risk estimate; every phase must stay under roughly 40%
of a context window, and the phases flagged for an internal a/b split (08, 09, 17, 23) say
so in their own file when the session runs hot.

## Closeout phases (post-25)

The core migration finished at Phase 25 (every REST surface behind the pipeline, the
`API_DISPATCH` default flipped to `'new'`, the pre-merge gate green). A closeout review
(2026-07-04) then surfaced three polish items, each its own focused, bisectable PR. They are
follow-ups, not blockers; the shipped pipeline is correct without them. Each pairs with its
`phase-NN-qa.md` when it runs.

| NN | Phase | QA | ctx |
|----|-------|----|-----|
| 26 | [Closeout cleanup: de-phase and de-stale the pipeline comments](phase-26-comment-cleanup.md) | DONE 2026-07-04, apply-all 0/0 (record: progress.md Phase 26; no separate qa file) | low |
| 27 | [Closeout: honor the flag-flip precondition (bound the log-only mismatch sinks)](phase-27-flip-precondition.md) | (on run) | low |
| 28 | [Closeout: complete or formally defer the four attack-signal RED metrics](phase-28-observability-metrics.md) | (on run) | low |

## Ground rules every phase keeps

- Server-only work. It must not touch `src/sim/` (Phase 22 is the one client-side touch:
  the `userFacingApiError` matcher in `src/main.ts` plus the `apiError.*` catalog).
- The same `src/sim/` core runs all three hosts, so determinism and sim purity stay intact;
  Phase 2 injects a `now()` clock so limiter tests are deterministic.
- Every player-visible string is a `t()` key in every locale. The server stays
  language-agnostic and emits a stable machine code re-localized at the client boundary.
- No em dashes, en dashes, or emojis anywhere (code, comments, docs, commits, copy).
- Conventional Commits with a scope. Commit with explicit paths, never `git add -A`, because
  the worktree is shared by concurrent sessions.
- Each phase is a PR; the pre-merge gate mirrors CI (`npm test`, `npx tsc --noEmit`,
  `npm run build:env`, `npm run build:server`, `npm run build`). Run `/qa` over the diff and
  dispatch only the reviewers whose surfaces the phase actually touches.
