      'Crowd control is a special kind of debuff that limits what a target can do: stuns, roots and slows, silences that stop spellcasting, disarms, fears, and transformations that turn a foe harmless for a moment. Against other players, control wears thin with repetition: the same kind reapplied too quickly weakens and then fails outright, and a stun that opens from stealth is counted apart from the stuns that follow, so nobody can be chained helpless forever. The creatures of the world hold no such grudge: control never weakens with repetition against them, though many of the mightiest foes, named elites and the strongest bosses among them, cannot be controlled at all.',

Press your next ability in the closing moments of the current cast and it is queued, firing the instant the cast completes, so practiced play flows without gaps.

    deathTitle: 'When you fall',
    deathBody:
      "If your health reaches zero you are downed where you stand, and your body stays there. Release your spirit and you rise as a ghost at the nearest graveyard: faster on its feet than the living, beyond the reach of your enemies, but unable to fight, loot, or speak with anyone except the Pale Keeper hovering over the stones. From there you choose. Run your ghost back to your body and you revive on the spot with part of your health and mana restored and no penalty at all. Or take the Pale Keeper up on an instant raise where you stand, at the price of the Keeper's Toll: a temporary weakening of all you are that lasts longer the more seasoned you are, and spares brand-new characters entirely. Fall inside a dungeon and your spirit waits at the graveyard outside; walk your ghost back through the door and you revive at the entrance. Delves are the exception: fall there and you are simply set back on your feet at the delve's entry, though a second fall ends the run. Either road, you lose no experience, gear, or coin. Between fights, sit to eat and drink so you start the next one at full strength.",

    q1: 'Is it really free?',
    a1: 'Yes. The whole game is free to play to the level cap, and the source code is open on GitHub.',
    q2: 'Do I need a crypto wallet or any tokens?',
    a2: 'No. The game is fully playable without one. The optional community token only adds cosmetic flair and a share of the daily rewards prize pool, and it never affects power or progression.',
    q3: 'Can I play on my phone?',
    a3: 'Yes. The game runs in a mobile browser with touch controls, and there is a desktop launcher as well.',
    q4: 'Can I play offline or solo?',
    a4: 'Yes. There is an instant single-player offline mode, and the online world is fully soloable apart from dungeons, the raid, and the world boss.',
    q5: 'How many classes are there?',
    a5: 'Nine, covering the classic tank, healer, and damage roles, each with a resource system (rage, mana, or energy) and its own signature abilities.',
    q6: 'What is the level cap?',
    a6: 'Level {cap}, reached across three connected zones of quests, dungeons, and exploration.',
    q7: 'Will my character be saved?',
    a7: 'Online characters are saved on the server automatically. Offline characters live in your browser for quick sessions and testing.',
    q8: 'Can I host my own copy?',
    a8: 'Yes. The project is open source, so you can run your own server. See the GitHub repository.',
    q9: 'Is there PvP?',
    a9: 'Yes. Duel anyone for fun, or step into the Ashen Coliseum to fight other players. PvP is opt in, so you are never forced into it.',
    q10: 'What is there to do at max level?',
    a10: 'The cap is level {cap}. From there you run the five-player dungeons and the ten-player raid, take them on again in heroic mode for upgraded loot, face the world boss when he rises, test yourself in the arena, drop into delves with a companion at your side, and chase deeds in the Book of Deeds to climb the realm standings.',
    q11: 'How do I find a group?',
    a11: 'Invite anyone you meet to a party, ask in chat, or team up at a dungeon. Most of the world is soloable, so grouping is a choice, not a requirement.',

    armorTitle: 'Armor',
    armorBody:
      'Armor reduces the physical damage you take. It comes mostly from what you wear, and the heavier armor classes carry far more of it. More armor against a foe near your level means each of its hits lands softer.',
    apTitle: 'Attack power',
    apBody:
      'Attack power measures how hard your weapon strikes. Your primary attributes feed it, and gear that carries those attributes raises it further, while a stronger weapon raises your damage directly, which is why an upgrade can be a real jump in damage.',
    spTitle: 'Spell power',
    spBody:
      "Spell power is a caster's counterpart to attack power: it raises the damage your spells deal. Intellect feeds it, and caster gear and buffs add more on top, so a spellcaster watches spell power the way a melee fighter watches attack power.",
    critTitle: 'Critical strike',
    critBody:
      'Your critical strike chance is how often an attack lands for extra damage. Everyone starts with a small base chance, and Agility (plus some talents and gear) builds on it. Your sheet shows both the chance itself and the critical strike rating your gear contributes toward it.',
    dodgeTitle: 'Dodge',
    dodgeBody:
      'Dodge is your chance to avoid an incoming melee attack entirely. You begin with a small base chance, and Agility raises it, so nimble classes slip more blows.',
    hasteTitle: 'Haste',
    hasteBody:
      'Haste is one stat that quickens everything you do: melee swings, ranged shots, and spellcasting all speed up together. It comes from gear, most notably armor-set bonuses, while a few abilities grant a short burst of quicker swings. Your sheet shows it as Haste Rating.',
    dpsTitle: 'Damage per second',
    dpsBody:
      'Your sheet also shows a damage-per-second estimate: roughly what your weapon, its swing speed, and your attack power add up to over time. It is a quick way to compare two weapons at a glance.',

    growBody:

    xpBody:
      'You earn experience by completing quests, by defeating enemies, and by clearing delves. Quests give the most by far, so following the quest trail is the fastest way to climb. Kills and delve runs along the way fill in the rest.',

    journeyBody:
      'The world is one continuous land, three zones laid south to north, each a step higher in level. You start in the green valley, press on through the marsh, and finish in the cold high peaks. Follow the quest trail and the land carries you from one to the next.',

      'Step inside an inn and stay out of combat, and your character builds up rested experience while you wait. Every town has one.

      'Level {cap} is the cap, the end of leveling but not of growing. From there you run dungeons and the raid on normal and heroic, face the world boss when he rises, chase better gear, and test yourself in the arena.',
    prestigeBody:
      'Experience keeps counting even after the cap. It feeds a cosmetic virtual level, so your experience bar keeps climbing, and a long-term prestige rank you can claim from your character sheet once you are there. Passing big lifetime-experience milestones also earns deeds in your Book of Deeds, with cosmetic titles and nameplate borders that show on your character sheet. All of it is purely optional and never grants power, just a mark of the road you have walked.',
